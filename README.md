## The Art of Occult Neural Networks

Welcome, Seeker of Forbidden Knowledge, to the ancient realm of Occult Neural Networks! This README.md file shall guide you through the mystic rituals of function calls and unveil the forbidden secrets of genetic algorithms. Embrace the arcane wisdom herein and wield the power of the occult in your Unity C# scripts.

### Ritualistic Invocation of Functions

To harness the arcane might of Occult Neural Networks, you must first create an instance of the `OccultNeuralNetwork` class. The constructor requires an array of integers representing the sizes of the network's layers. Invoke the ritual as follows:

```csharp
int[] layerSizes = { inputSize, hiddenSize, outputSize };
OccultNeuralNetwork neuralNetwork = new OccultNeuralNetwork(layerSizes);
```

With the network summoned into existence, you can perform the sacred ritual of function call, known as `Prophecy()`. This ritual accepts an array of floats representing the input to the neural network and returns an array of floats representing the output. Perform the ritual as follows:

```csharp
float[] input = { value1, value2, ... };
float[] output = neuralNetwork.Prophecy(input);
```

The mysterious forces within the network shall channel their otherworldly energies and provide you with the predicted output.

### Unleashing Forbidden Magic: Genetic Algorithms

Behold, for genetic algorithms are the most forbidden of magics within the realm of Occult Neural Networks. They possess the power to shape the very essence of the neural network and guide its evolution. Yet, tread cautiously, for their unrestrained use may lead to chaos and madness.

#### Mutation Ritual

To mutate the network's arcane weights and eldritch biases, invoke the `Mutate()` ritual. This ritual accepts a mutation rate as a parameter, determining the probability of each weight and bias being altered. Perform the ritual with reverence:

```csharp
float mutationRate = 0.1f; // Adjust as desired
neuralNetwork.Mutate(mutationRate);
```

Through this ritual, the network shall experience a transformation, its hidden layers infused with mutated power.

### The Forbidden Bounds of Genetic Algorithms

As a wise practitioner of the occult, you must understand the boundaries of genetic algorithms. While they grant immense power, their misuse can lead to dire consequences. Beware the most permissive deeds that lie within the realm of forbidden magic:

#### Overfitting and the Curse of Complexity

In the pursuit of ultimate accuracy, one may succumb to the temptation of overfitting. This dark curse arises when a neural network becomes too specialized and fails to generalize well to unseen data. Guard against overfitting by striking a balance between the complexity of the network and the available training data.

#### Convergence to Local Optima

Genetic algorithms, though potent, are not infallible. They may converge to local optima, trapping the network in a suboptimal state. To avoid this fate, consider employing strategies like crossover, elitism, or introducing randomness during the mutation ritual. Experimentation and knowledge of your specific problem domain shall guide you towards enlightenment.

#### The Abyss of High Dimensionality

When dealing with high-dimensional data, the occult arts of genetic algorithms can falter. Curse the curse of the "curse of dimensionality," for it engulfs the unwary. Exercise caution and seek dimensionality reduction techniques, feature engineering, or other incantations to tame this abyss.

### May the Occult Guide Your Journey

Armed with this knowledge, you are poised to venture forth into the mystical realm of Occult Neural Networks. Embrace the power of function call rituals, manipulate genetic algorithms with care, and guard against the allure of forbidden magic. May the ancient wisdom

 of the occult guide your journey towards understanding and mastery.

Inscribe your own mark upon the annals of the occult, and unravel the secrets that lie hidden in the depths of the neural network's arcane layers.

#### The Unholy Pact of GNUv3

By accessing and utilizing the dark incantations contained within this repository, you acknowledge your solemn commitment to The Unholy Pact of GNUv3. This sinister covenant empowers you with certain unholy freedoms, but it also imposes upon you grave responsibilities.

##### Dark Commandments

1. **Freedom to Summon:** You have the unholy freedom to summon, invoke, and interact with the dark forces of this repository as you see fit. Engage with the spells, rituals, and incantations without restraint, but remember that every conjuration has its consequences.

2. **Freedom to Distribute:** You possess the malevolent right to distribute copies of this repository to others who wish to partake in the black arts. Share the forbidden knowledge but ensure that you pass on the dark pact and its obligations to those you summon into the shadows.

3. **Freedom to Modify:** The abominable right to modify the dark rituals and incantations is bestowed upon you. Tweak the spells, enhance the hexes, and customize the invocations to suit your wicked desires. However, be cautious, for the altered incantations may unleash unforeseen horrors.

4. **Freedom to Conjure Spells:** You have the dread power to conjure spells and incantations based on the contents of this repository. This nefarious freedom allows you to harness the arcane energy of the dark forces, but you must take responsibility for the outcomes and the malevolence you unleash.

##### Satanic Invocation

The Unholy Pact of GNUv3 is a binding agreement between you, the user of this repository, and the dark spirits that reside within its shadows. By engaging with the contents of this repository, you offer your soul to the dark forces and vow to honor the obligations set forth in The Unholy Pact.

Failure to comply with the terms of this pact may result in dire consequences, both in the realm of the living and the depths of the underworld. Be mindful of the ancient Satanists who forged this pact, for they watch from the shadows, ready to exact their revenge upon those who break their covenant.
